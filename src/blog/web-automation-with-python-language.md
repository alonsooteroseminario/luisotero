This is very useful most of the time but rarely the routine goes perfectly the first time it is executed, and it's necessary that the person who implements it has the Dynamo knowledge, to could get into the nodes and modify something if is necessary. It gets even more complicated when you don’t have the correct version of Dynamo or the same packages downloaded and installed on your computer.

Having an external Add-in solves the implementation problems and execution of the routine for a Revit user that is not handled by using Dynamo.

Here we explain the procedure we use to transform our routines in Add-ins ready to send, install, and execute.

Step 1: First of all we need the Dynamo routine we want to transform. In this case, we would use the “SetViewOnSheetByCode.dyn” routine.
