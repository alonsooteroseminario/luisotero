### Revit + Dynamo: BIM MEP automation to find the entry and exit dimensions of all the pipes that intercept with the Sanitary Chambers.

How many times have you had to modify the inlet and outlet dimensions of the pipes of all the sanitary or sewer chambers of a project? If the project is small, that would mean this task is simple, so we use the “Elevation” option and visually find the new dimensions that changed. But what would happen if the project is bigger with more than 20 or 30 sanitary chambers and a designer constantly changing it? This task could take several hours of work along with a large concentration of the modeler so as not to be mistaken in the transfer of the data. Using the Dynamo tool, you can create custom routines that automatically find this in just seconds, and every time the project is modified, saving many hours of work for modelers and review hours for health specialists or Project coordinators.

Here we show you how:

Step 1: First you have to have a properly modeled project and partially coordinated with the other specialties and with all the pipes with their respective slopes and with the coherence of a real project. Once this is done, we proceed to execute the routines previously mentioned.
